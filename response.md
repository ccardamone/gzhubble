Major Issue I: Reorganization of Section 4
------------------------------------------
Section 4 has been reorganized in the manner suggested by the reviewer. The authors agree this structure will be more clear to the readers.

Major Issue II: Statistical Model
------------------------------------------
We tested a variety of models for fitting f/f_o, including linear, exponential, polynomial, and power, each testing a constant zeta parameter and a linear with surface brightness dependence. We compared the relative quality of fits using the AIC parameter, and found no great difference in the choice of model ***should quantify this if we can***, the details and code can be viewed in this python notebook (link eventually). Of these, we believe the best model is an exponential fit for f_features vs z with a linear (maybe??) zeta, based on the following:
